# BE188: Machine Learning and Data-Driven Modeling

### Instructor: 

[Professor Aaron Meyers](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/aaron-meyer-ph-d/)

### Class Description:

Manipulating biological systems requires techniques to interpret complex measurements. Project-based study introduces techniques for inferring biological meaning from experimental measurements using computational and analytical techniques. Objectives including giving students working knowledge of techniques for rigorously analysis of complex data sources; illustration of frontier and open challenges in computational systems biology and bioengineering; and ensuring familiarity with necessary tools to effectively apply computation as part of individual or group research effort. Introduction of foundational applied machine learning and statistics techniques. Laboratory session involves hands-on implementations from recent literature. Includes project-based work using recent literature-derived applications. Includes midterm exam, and final design project involving novel analysis of data derived from literature using course techniques.
